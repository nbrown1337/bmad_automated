# Phase 18: API Examples - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A quick-start cookbook with recipe-style examples showing "How to do X" with the CLI. When someone wants to accomplish a task with bmad-automate, they can find a relevant recipe, see the command pattern, and adapt it to their situation.

Focus on CLI usage patterns — the commands, flags, and scenarios developers will actually encounter. Examples should feel like real workflows people would use, not contrived demos created just for documentation.

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Real scenarios** — Show actual workflows people would use, not artificial examples
- **CLI-focused** — Command usage patterns with run, queue, epic commands and their flags
- **Practical utility** — Each example solves a real problem someone might have

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Library/SDK integration examples — CLI only, no Go package usage
- Video or interactive tutorials — text-based markdown only
- Configuration deep-dives — focus on commands, not config file setup
- Exhaustive flag documentation — that's CLI_REFERENCE.md, not cookbook

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard cookbook approaches that show real CLI usage patterns.

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This completes the v1.2 Documentation milestone. The examples should complement the existing CLI_REFERENCE.md (which documents flags) and USER_GUIDE.md (which explains concepts) by showing practical, copy-and-adapt command patterns.
