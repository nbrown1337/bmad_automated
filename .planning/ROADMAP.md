### 🚧 v1.1 Full Story Lifecycle (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Run the complete story lifecycle (create→dev→review→commit) for each story before moving to the next, with error recovery, dry-run mode, and enhanced progress UI.

#### Phase 6: Lifecycle Definition ✅

**Goal**: Define the full workflow sequence per status and status transitions
**Depends on**: v1.0 complete
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:

- [x] 06-01: Story Lifecycle Sequence (TDD) — completed 2026-01-08

**Details:**

- Add `git-commit` to the workflow chain after `code-review`
- Define status transitions: create→ready-for-dev, dev→review, review→done
- Update router package with lifecycle sequence logic

#### Phase 7: Story Lifecycle Executor

**Goal**: New package that runs the complete workflow sequence for one story
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: 0/2 complete

Plans:

- [ ] 07-01: Status Writer (TDD) - Add UpdateStatus to status package
- [ ] 07-02: Lifecycle Executor (TDD) - Orchestrate full story lifecycle

**Details:**

- New `lifecycle` package in `internal/lifecycle`
- Executor runs: status→workflow→update status→next workflow→etc.
- Ends with git-commit+push→mark done
- Updates sprint-status.yaml after each step

#### Phase 8: Update Run Command

**Goal**: `run <story>` executes full lifecycle, not just one workflow
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 08-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 8 to break down)

**Details:**

- `run` command uses lifecycle executor
- Completes story entirely: create→dev→review→commit→done

#### Phase 9: Update Epic Command

**Goal**: Epic uses lifecycle executor, full cycle per story before moving to next
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 09-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 9 to break down)

**Details:**

- Epic command uses lifecycle executor
- Each story runs to completion before next story starts
- Maintains existing fail-fast behavior

#### Phase 10: Update Queue Command

**Goal**: Queue also uses lifecycle executor for consistency
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 10-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 10 to break down)

**Details:**

- Queue command uses lifecycle executor
- Consistent behavior with epic and run commands

#### Phase 11: Error Recovery & Resume

**Goal**: Save progress state when workflow fails, resume from failure point
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 11-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 11 to break down)

**Details:**

- Save lifecycle state to file when workflow fails
- `--resume` flag to continue from failure point
- Track which step failed and resume from there

#### Phase 12: Dry Run Mode

**Goal**: Preview what would happen without executing
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 12-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 12 to break down)

**Details:**

- `--dry-run` flag for run, queue, epic commands
- Shows workflow sequence without executing
- Lists stories and their lifecycle steps

#### Phase 13: Enhanced Progress UI

**Goal**: Better visibility into lifecycle progress
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 13-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 13 to break down)

**Details:**

- Show current step and remaining steps
- Overall epic/queue progress indicator
- Estimated time based on previous story durations
