# Contributing to bmad-automate

Thank you for your interest in contributing to bmad-automate! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmad-automate.git`
3. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Run tests: `just check`
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting

### Building

```bash
just build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run with verbose output
just test-verbose

# Run with coverage
just test-coverage

# Test a specific package
just test-pkg ./internal/claude
```

### Code Quality

Before submitting a PR, please run:

```bash
just check
```

This runs:

- `go fmt` - Format code
- `go vet` - Static analysis
- `go test` - Run tests

For more thorough linting:

```bash
just lint
```

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` for formatting (run `just fmt`)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Architecture Overview

The codebase follows a layered CLI architecture with dependency injection for testability:

```
CLI → Lifecycle → Workflow → Claude
```

- **CLI Layer** receives commands and delegates to lifecycle or workflow
- **Lifecycle Layer** orchestrates multi-step story execution with state persistence
- **Workflow Layer** executes individual workflows
- **Claude Layer** handles subprocess communication and JSON parsing

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed diagrams and data flow.

```

### Package Guidelines

- **cli**: Thin command handlers that delegate to other packages
- **claude**: Claude CLI interaction, streaming JSON parsing
- **config**: Configuration loading and validation
- **lifecycle**: Full story lifecycle execution from status to done
- **output**: All terminal output and styling
- **router**: Status-based workflow routing
- **state**: State persistence for error recovery and resume
- **status**: Sprint status file reading and writing
- **workflow**: Business logic for workflow execution

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Use `testify` for assertions and mocking
- Aim for good coverage on business logic packages
- Test files should be named `*_test.go`

### Mocking

The codebase uses interfaces for testability:

- `claude.Executor` - Mock Claude execution
- `output.Printer` - Capture output for testing
- `lifecycle.WorkflowRunner` - Mock workflow execution for lifecycle tests
- `status.Reader` / `status.Writer` - Mock sprint status operations

Example (Claude mock):

```go
func TestMyFeature(t *testing.T) {
    mock := &claude.MockExecutor{
        Events: []claude.Event{...},
        ExitCode: 0,
    }
    // Use mock in tests
}
```

Example (Lifecycle mock):

```go
func TestLifecycleExecution(t *testing.T) {
    mockRunner := &MockWorkflowRunner{
        RunSingleFunc: func(ctx context.Context, workflow, storyKey string) int {
            return 0 // Success
        },
    }
    mockReader := &MockStatusReader{
        Status: status.StatusBacklog,
    }
    executor := lifecycle.NewExecutor(mockRunner, mockReader, mockWriter)
    // Test lifecycle execution
}
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass (`just check`)
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Add a clear description of your changes
4. Reference any related issues
5. Request review from maintainers
